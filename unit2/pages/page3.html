<h1>Reasons you need a Pt Cruiser</h1>
<p>I didn't really know what to do with this page, but I needed something so I wanted to list reasons why you need the ugliest car in existence.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They have really good handling and they are fun to drive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They don't have that good of gas mileage but they make up for it with pretty good acceleration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are absolutely stupid ugly, you will never get a speeding ticket because cops will usually look away in disgust whenever they see one, or so I've been told.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pull up next to a really fast car and rev the engine really loud, reactions are priceless.</p>
</li>
</ol>
